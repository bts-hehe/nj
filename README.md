- CCS: 
  1. Download as zip or clone to C: as a folder that should be named ```win-main```. Run whatever is necessary.
  2. remember to delete folder once you are done
- RvB: 
  1. from USB, only copy ```rvb.bat```. You should type ```rvb_pass``` by hand because its short.
  2. remember to delete scripts if you have time. Just delete ```rvb.bat```.

**NOTES:**
You really only need to edit `users.txt` and `admins.txt` during competition optimally.
