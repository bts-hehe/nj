# win
- CCS: 
  1. Download as zip or clone to C: as a folder that should be named ```win-main```. Run whatever is necessary.
  2. remember to delete folder once you are done
- RvB: 
  1. from USB, only copy ```rvb.bat```. You should type ```rvb_pass``` by hand because its problematic to script.
  2. remember to delete scripts if you have time. In any case, ```rvb.bat``` should be pretty lightweight.
